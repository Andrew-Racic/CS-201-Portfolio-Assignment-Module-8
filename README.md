# CS-201-Portfolio-Assignment-Module-8
For this course, you will select one project to submit into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. You should submit all relevant files from your selected project to your GitHub repository.
These will showcase your work with programming languages and most specifically C++. These files also demonstrate your ability to write well-documented and readable code, design functional 
programs that meet industry standards, and use multiple programming languages to develop secure and efficient code.

You will also reflect on the work that you have done in this project. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It will help add context to refresh your memory when you use
your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below, using the sub-bullets to help guide your thoughts.
You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

What did you do particularly well?  
In this project I feel that I did really well on the tracking part and and creating the histogram.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code and the finally product for the end user by adding Corner Grocers logo and making it appealing to the user.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you
adding to your support network?
 The use of std::map for tracking item frequencies is a key part of this code. Understanding how maps work and how to iterate over
 them might be challenging for beginners. This is overcome by learning about STL (Standard Template Library) and its various containers.
 Websites like cppreference.com and cplusplus.com are great resources for understanding the functionalities of various libraries and 
 functions in C++.
 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The use of std::map and std::string in this code is a good practice of using STL containers, which is a transferable skill 
for any C++ project.  The skills of reading from and writing to files are widely applicable in many projects and coursework.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My code is well-commented which improves readability and maintainability.  The code follows a consistent coding style (like the
placement of braces, spaces, etc.) which makes it easier to read.  he code is divided into functions each performing a specific
task, improving maintainability and adaptability. For example, if you want to change how items are added, you only need to modify
the addItem function.   The code checks for potential errors (like failure to open a file) and handles them gracefully, which makes 
the code more robust and maintainable.
